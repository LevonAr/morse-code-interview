# Morse Code Translator

This is a basic interview question involving translating plain text to morse code.

To get started, run:

`git clone https://github.com/safetybelt/morse-code-interview.git`

You can then open `index.html` in a browser and everything should be hooked up already.  The translation process is up to you.
